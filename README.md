# MATLAB-Arduino-
This is the code I used to program an Arduino to do various different things.
## Ultrasonic Sensor 
- This code tests/senses the distance an object is away from the arduino using an Ultrasonic Sensor.
## Hall Sensor 
- This code is for a hall effect sensor that will count the amount of times a magnet runs by the sensor for 15 seconds. The Hall sensor is attatched to an arduino and we wish to test how different gears on a bike affect the number of rotations of a bike tire. The magnet will be attatched to a bike wheel.
## Musical Arduino
-  When you press a colored button (Red, Green, or Yellow) the light that corresponds with the button color lights up and blinks 5 times. It is followed by a buzz 
sound. Each button had a different buzz pitch sound.
## Force Arduino
- This program uses a force sensor on an arduino to sense how much weight is being applied and turns on the LED lights corresponding to the force applied.
